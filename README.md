Software system for the employment of IT specialists.

Unfortunately, sometimes IT companies have such a situation that after completion of the project there is no work on new projects for entire teams. Yes, some companies can afford to keep workers on a bench, internal projects, but not all. But even at the bench, not everyone agrees to stay, so experts are forced to look for a new job.

That is, the system solves the following problems:
💪 hiring IT specialists quickly and profitably, as employees have proven experience and recommendations from a previous company;

💪 closing vacancies in IT companies looking for high-quality specialists;

💪 the reputation of IT companies does not suffer, because they do their best to get their employees a good offer from another company.
